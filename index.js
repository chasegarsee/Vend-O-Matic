/* THE PLAN */

// 1: Initialize the Vending Machine Data.
// 2: Both GET requests to allow data visualization (maybe add a bonus request in to see how many coins/Â¢ have been accrued?).
// 3: PUT request to handle coin insertion.
// 4: PUT request to handle beverage purchase. Including error handling if item is out of stock, or insufficient coins.
// 5: DELETE request to handle coin returns.
